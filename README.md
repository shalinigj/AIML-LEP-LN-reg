Factors Influencing Life Expectancy using Linear Regression

There have been lot of studies undertaken in the past, on factors affecting life expectancy, considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates.
It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past.
Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this case study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well.
In this case study, we will use linear regression to see the effect of various factors on Life Expectancy.
